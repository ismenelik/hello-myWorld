colab with three authors to create

story about schooner trades

tech developed civ set in vicky period

spies and love and betrayal

i'd like to add the apocalytptic nature and steampunkishness of it all

steam powered schooners

neo colonial intrigue

I'd like to add vicky and steamy aspects


Let's add characters:
- Voland
- Viola
- Albiol, the enemy

The hero leaves in a hopeless quest and when he returns many things have changed.

This is a story about a friendship lost a love lost but also the things that were gained.

Points of contention?
